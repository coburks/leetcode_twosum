Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.













print interger as a string , assign string to variable a
print a reversed as a string, assign string to variable b

if a == b
    return true
else
    return false








list = [a,b]

for n in list:
    if n == n
        return True 
    else:
        return False












but if we wanted to check it without a string, 
we know that any number divided by itself = 1 
so we can take x and divide by y
if x/y = 1 then x is a palindrome

how to generate y, which is x but reversed
what if we converted x to a floating point number then evaluated the value of each digit place
in each place were reversed
